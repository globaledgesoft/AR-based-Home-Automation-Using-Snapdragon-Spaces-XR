# Smart Home Automation by Using AR with XR Interaction
## Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop an augmented reality (AR) based smart home automation application by integrating Lenovo ThinkReality AR glasses with the XR Interaction Toolkit from Snapdragon Spaces Augmented Reality SDK for Android. These AR glasses offer an immersive augmented reality display, while the XR Interaction Toolkit provides precise Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition capabilities. The Snapdragon Spaces SDK enables effortless integration with the smart home system, allowing users to effortlessly control and manipulate smart devices using intuitive hand gestures, thereby enhancing the overall smart home experience.
